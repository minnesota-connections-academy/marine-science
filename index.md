# Marine Science - End of Semester Research Questions

[TOC]

### Questions that you all posed! Take a moment to read them!

#### Questions from: *How big is the ocean?*

* If humans were to create an underwater place to live in, what would be good materials to use?
* How does the ocean define us and how do we define the ocean?
* How does the largeness of the ocean affect human progress?
* What kind of tool would you create to reach deeper than ever seen before in the ocean?
* With how deep the ocean is, do you think that there is life forms with thought processes like a humans?
* How do the plants deep in our ocean survive without any kind of sunlight or is there any kind of sunlight? Also is there any kind of photosynthesis within our oceans?
* How can we explore more of the ocean?
* What are two things someone can do everyday to contribute to a healthier ocean?
* How much of the worlds water is the ocean connected to via rivers and lakes?
* What is a sea compared to an ocean?
* A lot of the ocean remains undiscovered simply because of the sheer amount of pressure found at some depths. As explained in the video, the Challenger's Deep is the deepest point in the ocean. How much pressure do you think is exerted at that depth in comparison to our current atmospheric pressure on land?

#### Questions from: *The hidden devastations caused by zebra mussels*

* How can we help control the population of Zebra Mussels to lessen devastation?
* How can we help decrease the spread of Zebra Mussels to other lakes?
* Why don't more people know about the extent of zebra mussel destruction?
* How can we clean up the "bad algae" off the bottom of lakes to prevent fish from consuming it and killing loons?
* How long have these Zebra Mussels been around and we have really not known about them? And what can we really do to make sure that these don't spread from lake to lake and also how can me make everyone understand how important it is to check your boats every time you leave one lake to another lake?
* How can we prevent zebra muscles from invading the great lakes and other lakes of Minnesota? How far do the effects go into the food chain/web of the great lakes?
* How many zebra mussels are there in the great lakes? Is there a way to get an estimate?

#### Questions from: *Are we running out of clean water?*

* How can we make clean water more affordable to keep clean?
* How would using less water impact the cattle industry? Why don't we just take some water out of the glaciers?
* I would like to learn more about becoming vegetarian and how that might positively effect this problem. Is there any negative effects from doing it?

### The Assignment!

Write an independent research project that takes a closer look at one of these questions. The standard option is to write an essay (between 500 and 1000 words). The essay should attempt to answer the question or answer questions that are related to your chosen question. Some of these questions are great starting off points, but might need to be expanded upon before writing an essay. For example, "How does the largeness of the ocean affect human progress?", is a really interesting question! But you would probably want to clarify or make it more specific before you start. You might ask "how has the ocean depths made it difficult for us to explore them?" or "how has knowledge of ocean currents affected commerce and trade throughout human history?" You may find that one question leads to another and then another. You have potentially endless curious topics to research about! The point is, use one of the questions above as a starting off point. You can even use one of the questions that you yourself asked!

### Requirements

* It is between 500 and 1000 words.
* It relates to Marine Science
* Your work is cited.
  * Cite information any time you are describing facts or information that you had to look up. Even if you didn't have to look it up, you should cite it if you would expect that most other people would not know it off the top of their head. In other words, cite things that aren't "common knowledge".
  * Citations should not be from Wikipedia. You can start at Wikipedia but you should cite the original source. (You can find sources that a Wikipedia article uses at the bottom of the Wikipedia page - this is a great place to start research from.)
* It has at least one citation from here: [ScienceDaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/)
  * ScienceDaily.com is a blog that posts recent science findings and empirical articles. The nice thing is that they summarize these articles for you, so you can simply cite the ScienceDaily summary in your essay.

### Other potential ideas!

Instead of an essay you could also create:

* A website/blog
* A video or recorded presentation
* Other idea? Run it past me!
